# LibertyGlobalProject2
The project was created as a service that allows you to store the ip and port, as well as their current status, in the Postgresql database deployed in the docker container.

To use this service (instructions for Ubuntu 18.04), in the project folder, enter the following:
#### sudo docker-compose up -d
<python3 app.py>
